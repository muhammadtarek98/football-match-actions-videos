- Its dataset consists of the actions that happened in football matches like scoring a goal, tackling, and eliminating by a red card.
- I create the first video dataset on Kaggle about football match actions with my colleagues as an AI intern at Orange Digital Center Egypt and Instant Software Solutions [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itarek898/football-match-actions-video-dataset)
- I use CNN-RNN architecture using feature  extractor CNN as CNN design pattern integrated with time-distributed layer, GRU as sequence part.
- the implementation using Keras (sequential API), and the model achieves particularly reliable results.
